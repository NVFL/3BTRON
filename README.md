This is the repository associated with the paper "3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network". 

## Files

Here, we provide a description of the files made available in this repository.

### The Model

To promote the sharing of resources, we provide the trained model described in the paper, optimised for the PyTorch framework (3BTRON.pt).

### Scripts

This folder contains all associated code (including scripts for data pre-processing, training and evaluation, stratification and for generating and visualising GradCAM heatmaps).

### Data

The data presented in this study can be found on Zenodo at:

### Experiments

Code for experiments and figures presented in this study will be made available by the corresponding author upon reasonable request. 

## Set-up

Create the environment from the environment.yml file:
```python
conda env create -f environment.yml
```python

Activate the environment: 
```python
conda activate img-classification
```python

Verify that the environment was installed correctly:
