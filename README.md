# 3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network

To promote the sharing of resources, we provide the trained model described in the paper "3BTRON: A Blood-Brain Barrier Recognition Network" optimized for the PyTorch framework. Associated code (including scripts for data pre-processing, stratification and for generating and visualising GradCAM heatmaps) are also provided.

The 'requirements.txt' file lists all the dependencies needed to install and run the model and associated code.
